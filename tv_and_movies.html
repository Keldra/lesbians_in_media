      Many people know of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_(TV_series)" target="_blank"
        ><i>Arcane</i></a
      >, the Netflix TV show based off <i>League of Legends</i> where two of the
      main characters, Vi and Caitlyn, are both lesbians. Arcane is just one in
      a history of lesbians being on the screen. The first kiss between two
      women was actually in the 1922 movie
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter_(1922_film)"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>Manslaughter</i></a
      >, and it was actually the first kiss between two people of the same
      gender on the screen, regardless of gender. It would be 8 more years
      before a leading lady would kiss someone of the same gender, and it would
      be sapphic actress Marlene Dietrich in

      Vampires have a very clear translation into lesbian media, as they have
      always represented the sexual "other", which is something that lesbians
      can relate to very well in a society that centers men. The first film to
      depict a lesbian vampire was
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula%27s_Daughter"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>Dracula's Daughter</i>
      </a>
      in 1936. It is the first time that we see a vampire who considers themself
      to be "afflicted" and needs to be "cured" of their vampirism, which
      showcases how people of the time viewed queerness. Due to industry
      standards at the time (Hay's Code), the main character, Countess Marya
      Zaleska, had to die at the end of the film because of her sexual deviancy.
      However, starting in the late 1960's continuing into the 1980's, there is
      an uprise in not just female vampires, but
      <em>lesbian</em> vampires, a notable example being
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_Darkness"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>Daughters of Darkness</i></a
      >, which showcases how the civil rights movements happening at the time
      affected a lot of films, especially horror as horror tends to touch more
      on the politics of oppression than a lot of other genres. Of course, this
      built up to Willow and Tara kissing on
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a
      >
      (even if they themselves were not vampires). And, of course, the short-run
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kill_(TV_series)"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>First Kill</i></a
      >
      from 2022, which has a lesbian vampire main character, but was canceled
      after just one season, which is often the case with tv shows that have
      lesbian main characters.

      While both characters are canonically bisexual, the relationship between
      Korra and Asami in
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>The Legend of Korra</i></a
      >
      should <em>absolutely</em> be mentioned, as it helped more openly queer
      female and nonbinary characters come into children's cartoons.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe" target="_blank"
        ><i>Steven Universe</i></a

      had a lot of diversity in characters, including a main character, Garnet,
      who is a fusion of two lesbian gems, Ruby and Sapphire and showcases a
      beautiful butchfemme relationship. In addition to Garnet, another main
      character in <i>Steven Universe</i>, Pearl is also a lesbian. While there
      were many queer characers in
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra_and_the_Princesses_of_Power"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</i></a
      >, the main character Adora (She-Ra) and her best friend turned enemy
      turned girlfriend Catra are both lesbians. Disney's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Owl_House" target="_blank"
        ><i>The Owl House</i></a
      >
      also has multiple LGBTQ+ characters, including lesbian main character
      Amity Blight. This only some of the bigger cartoons with lesbian
      characters, but there are many more. It is especially important for queer
      characters to be shown, age appropriately, in children's media so that if
      they are like that, or they have friends or family who may be queer, they
      will see that it's okay and there's nothing wrong with it, it's just how
      some people are.

      Similarly to yuri manga, yuri anime tends to be far less common than
      heterosexual anime and tends to only get one season, while other animes
      may get multiple seasons.
