    <p>
      You cannot talk about lesbians in literature without mentioning
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Butch_Blues" target="_blank"
        ><i>Stone Butch Blues</i></a
      >
      by Leslie Feinburg. It is a fictional recounting of a working class butch
      lesbian in the second half of the 20th century. While it is fictional,
      Feinburg drew heavily from her own experiences as a butch lesbian and many
      butches to this day find it relatable in some ways. It is also a book that
      sheds light on the underrepresented butchfemme community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another work that must be mentioned is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_Purple" target="_blank"
        ><i>The Color Purple</i></a
      >, which has won the Pulitzer Prize (making Alice Walker the first Black
      woman to receive the award) and is included on AP English reading lists.
      The novel has been adapted into many forms, including two movies, a
      musical, and a radio broadcast. However, it <em>has</em> faced many
      controversies as well, due to the content, and has spent many years in the
      list of top 100 banned books.
    </p>

    <p>
      An early work of fiction that mentions lesbians is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_(Plato)" target="_blank"
        >Symposium</a
      >
      by Plato (300's BC), which is about how pairs of soulmates were all
      originally one body with two faces. But, even before he was born,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho" target="_blank">Sappho</a>
      was writing poems. While she wrote about many things, her most famous
      poems, both at the time <em>and</em> to this day, were her love poems,
      most of which were written to or about other women. It is because of this
      that lesbians are called lesbians (as she was born and lived on the island
      of Lesbos) and that women who love other women, regardless of sexuality,
      are called sapphic. She was generally highly regarded, and many people,
      including Plato, referred to her as the "tenth Muse" and she continues to
      influence writers even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly the first novel with a lesbian main character would be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla" target="_blank"
        ><i>Carmilla</i></a
      >
      by Sheridan Le Fanu, an Irish writer. This novella popularized the lesbian
      vampire trope and is considered to be one of the most influential vampire
      works, as well as predating <i>Dracula</i> by 25 years. Vampirism has long
      been a symbol of sexuality (heterosexual, yes, but
      <em>especially</em> queer). Though some lesbians of today embrace
      <i>Carmilla</i>, it was originally written to demonize lesbian behavior
      and uphold heteronormality.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as a "a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist
      newspaper", the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" target="_blank"
        >Bechdel test</a
      >, was started by lesbian cartoonist Alison Bechdel. It has grown from
      that little joke into being something that is widely known and has had
      spin-offs for other intersections of lack of privilege. Her most notable
      works are <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i> (one of the earliest ongoing
      representations of lesbians in popular culture, and ran from 1983-2008),
      <i>Fun Home</i> (a graphic memoir published in 2006), and
      <i>Are You My Mother?</i> (a second graphic memoir published in 2012).

      Luckily, in the modern day, there are plenty of books (fictional and
      nonfictional) that have lesbians in them, including positive depictions.
      Unfortunately, they do tend to be less in number <em>and</em> promoted
      less than their heterosexual counterparts or even compared to stories
      which depict men together with each other. This is especially shown in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_(genre)" target="_blank"
        >Yuri</a
      >
      manga. Many end up failing before they can even get official English
      translations or even a second Japanese volume. Most recently,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Bullet" target="_blank"
        >Love Bullet</a
      >
      was on the verge of cancellation, but through a campaign mostly on
      Twitter, the series was saved and the first volume in Japanese sold out
      multiple times at multiple stores and had to be restocked. However, not
      all series get a happy ending.
      <i>Gal Maid and Villainess: Only Milady's Happy End Will Win</i> is one
      that was recently cancelled.
