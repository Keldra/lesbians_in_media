      As long as media has existed, in its many forms, lesbians and sapphics
      have been a part of it. In ancient Greece, we had
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho" target="_blank">Sappho</a>
      (the namesake of sapphics) writing poems, her most famous being those that
      were about other women. And, of course, lesbians continue to be a vital,
      if underserved part of media to this day.

    <p>
      Lesbians create music, write literature and are involved in all steps of
      TV shows and movies, from writing them and starring in them to directing
      them and hair and make-up. Though it is more rare for lesbian stories to
      be told, due to not only sexism, but also homophobia and the wage-gap.
